Unlike sunlight which is non-polarised and comprises a large range of different wavelengths, the radar is a laser which operates within narrow and well-defined wavelength bands, and at a specific polarisation."

Specular double-bounce scattering can under certain circumstances also be observed e.g. in urban areas with buildings oriented towards the radar, in open waters by ships, bridges and oil platforms, as well as in irrigated rice fields through interactions between the plant stems (when vertical) and the water surface."

At L-band, a common type of volume scattering is the one that occurs on twigs and branches within a forest canopy. At the shorter C-band wavelength, volume scattering can take place within the canopies of lower or sparse vegetation types, such as bushes, shrubs or agricultural crops. Since the orientation of the main scatterers is random, the polarisation of the backscattered signal is also random, rendering equal backscatter in co- and cross-polarisation. "
