In the example above, the left image shows a section of the Negro River floodplain acquired by Sentinel-1 during (assumed) “normal” weather conditions, while the right image shows the same area acquired by the same sensor a few weeks earlier during a heavy rain storm. The darker “cloud-like” features visible in the central part of the right image are caused by attenuation of the C-band radar signal by the dense rain clouds. Wave effects caused by the heavy rain and/or strong wind are also visible on the water surface (blue/purple in the RGB image). "
